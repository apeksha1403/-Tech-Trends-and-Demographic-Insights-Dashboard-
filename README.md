# üìä Tech Trends and Demographic Insights Dashboard

This project explores technology usage trends and demographic insights using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It covers the complete data workflow: data collection via APIs and web scraping, data cleaning and normalization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, correlation analysis, and visual storytelling through graphs and dashboards.
